										 While our confidence in our editing services is unwavering, factors outside an applicant's writing may affect their admission. As such, Apricus Prep is not to be held responsible for the outcome of an applicant's admissions process. Further, Apricus Prep confidentially holds copies of final edits provided to each client to serve as proof of scholarly contribution and to prevent further changes made by the applicant (or other parties) to their writing being attributed to Apricus Prep editing services. This includes, but is not limited to, further edits made after feedback is given by Apricus Prep, an omission of feedback given by Apricus Prep, or any edits beyond the scope of the written feedback on the common shared document. <br>
										<br>
										 Apricus Prep is here to help, but the sole owner of the writing is the client and any words ultimately submitted by the client/applicant to admissions programs is understood to belong to the client/applicant. Apricus Prep does its due diligence in preventing academic dishonesty by maintaining confidence and compartmentalizing each clients' documents. We (Apricus Prep) further contend that our ideas for feedback are individualized for each client and any incidental reptition of concepts or phrasing will always be merely coincidental. While we are consistenly ensuring uniqueness of our own feedback, the writing process may produce coincidental accounts of a similar phrase between two pieces of text. Therefore, the client understands that the client themselves is responsible for assuring academic honesty (i.e. checking for plagiarism and validity of content) in their final admissions submissions. </p>
